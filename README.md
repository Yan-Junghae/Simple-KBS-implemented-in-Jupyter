# Knowledge Representation Assignment

## Description
This project demonstrates knowledge representation using facts and rules in Artificial Intelligence.
Facts are stored as structured triples, and logical rules are applied to infer new knowledge.

## What the Notebook Does
- Stores facts about entities and their relationships
- Applies inference rules to generate new facts
- Allows querying of inferred knowledge
- Displays all results directly in the notebook

## Originality Change
For originality, an additional rule was added to infer that a person who can access the library can also read books.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells to see the inference and query results.
